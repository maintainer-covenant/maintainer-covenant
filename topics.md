This file is a place to draft and keep track of possible topics around which the covenant will be organised.

Tenets:

  - Software developers are human beings and deserve to be treated as such. (Can't really believe this has to be said, but oh well...)
  - Burnout, distress, anxiety are real and significant problems.
  - Using fake internet points as career fuel is harmful.
  - Hustle-porn is harmful.
  - We are all involved. If you're not part of the solution, you might be part of the problem.
  - Everyone is different. If you don't like this covenant, you can adapt it or choose not to use it.

Covenants:

All development including bug fixes is conducted on a "best efforts" basis. This includes time, knowledge, equipment (e.g. for testing) and more. If any of these are lacking in some way, this will reduce the speed or likelihood that a feature will appear or a bug will be fixed.
